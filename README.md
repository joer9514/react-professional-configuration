# react-professional-configuration

### `FREE`

Welcome to the most professional React configuration template you can find!

This project is set up so that you only focus on the coding as I have done all the dirty work for you. You can play with the settings if you wish, but I recommend that you don't as it has very advanced and perfectly calculated settings.

## How to use this template

at the top right, right where the clone button is, there is a new button so you can use this template completely from ZERO in your new project.

## How to install

```bash
pnpm i
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```
