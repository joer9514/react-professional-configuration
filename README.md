# React-professional-configuration

### FREE

Welcome to the most professional React configuration template you can find!

This project is set up so that you only focus on the coding as I have done all the dirty work for you. You can play with the settings if you wish, but I recommend that you don't as it has very advanced and perfectly calculated settings.

## How to use this template

At the top right, right where the clone button is, there is a new button so you can use this template completely from ZERO in your new project.

## How to install

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How to test

```bash
npm run test
```

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
